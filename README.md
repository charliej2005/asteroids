# Asteroids

Asteroids is a Python project that clones the classic Asteroids game using Pygame and object-oriented programming principles.  
This project is part of the [Boot.dev guided project series](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-asteroids-python).

## Features

- Game loop implemented with Pygame
- User input handling for interactive gameplay
- Game state management
- Object-oriented structure for creating and managing game objects and their interactions

## Usage

1. (Optional, but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Unix/macOS
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the game:
